简单来说，就是先把重要的事情做完了再玩。

Some days when I’m not getting anything done, I’ve got this lingering guilt that I’m having a “zero day”. This prevents me from fully enjoying whatever activity I’m doing. I’ve tried just giving myself permission to enjoy whatever I’m doing, but it just doesn’t work. Ostensibly I’m taking time off and recharging, but it doesn’t feel like that at all – it feels like pushing through. This can lead to a negative feedback loop, where I’m constantly trying to recharge, but just getting more tired.

I’ve found the only way is to get some good work done first, then I can be fully immersed in whatever fun slacking-off activity I dive into.
